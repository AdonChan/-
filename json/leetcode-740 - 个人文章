Delete and Earn描述：\nGiven an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.\n\nIn each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.\n\nYou start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: nums = [3, 4, 2]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nDelete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.\nThen, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.\nExample 2:\nInput: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation:\n    Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.\n    Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3     points.\n9 total points are earned.\n\n\nclass Solution(object):\n    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums):\n        points=[0]*1001\n        # print(points)\n        for num in nums:\n            points[num]+=num\n        prev,curr=0,0\n        for point in points:\n            prev,curr=curr,max(point+prev,curr)\n        return curr\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    st=Solution()\n    nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4,4,4,5,5]\n    out=st.deleteAndEarn(nums)\n    print(out)\n\n                ", "mainLikeNum": ["0 "], "mainBookmarkNum": "0"}
