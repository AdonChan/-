It can be used for processing text, numbers, images,scientific data and just about anything else you might save on a computer.应用领域：软件开发、科学计算、自动化运维、云计算、WEB开发、网络爬虫、数据分析、人工智能\n\nJava\nIn today’s world, Java has a vast variety of different uses.For example, Java is used for web-applications like Google docs,as well as for things like mobile games. Perhaps most notably,Java is widely used to build small application modulesor applets for use as part of a web page.应用领域：Android应用、Web应用程序、嵌入式、大数据技术、科学学术应用\n\nJavascript\nJavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language.This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it,the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browserto do something with it.应用领域：前端、后端、桌面开发、插件开发、机器学习（TransFlow.js）\n\nPHP\nPHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily forweb development but also used as a general-purpose programming language.Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP reference implementationis now produced by The PHP Development Team.应用领域：网站开发\n\nC#\nC# is mostly used with Microsoft's .NET framework to design web forms,web applications, windows applications etc. Websiteand web application development using Asp. net is the most popularand most commercial use of C# currently.应用领域：Windows桌面开发、网络开发\n\nC\nC was initially used for system development work,in particular the programs that make-up the operating system.Why use C? Mainly because it produces code that runs nearlyas fast as code written in assembly language.应用领域：系统开发\n\nC++\nC++ is one of the most versatile languages in the world.It is used nearly everywhere for everything….systems programming (operating systems, device drivers,database engines, embedded, Internet of Things, etc.) numericaland scientific computing.应用领域：系统开发、游戏开发、金融领域\n\nRuby\nThe Ruby Programming language is a general purpose programming language.It is used in a wide range of fields, but is best known as a language forWeb Applications, because of the Ruby on Rails framework.应用领域：网站开发、\n\nSwift\nSwift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming languagedeveloped by Apple Inc. for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux.Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworksand the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products.应用领域：苹果周边开发\n\nGo/Golang\nGolang is the best programming language for developingserver side applications. Golang has capability tohandle multiple requests at a time and can deal with itby giving high performance. Again it is very easy to use as its syntaxis simple and everyone can be familiar with it easily.应用领域：Web开发\n\nScala\nScala is a general-purpose programming language providing support forfunctional programming and a strong static type system.Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed toaddress criticisms of Java.应用领域：大数据\n\nR\nR is a programming language and free software environment forstatistical computing and graphics that is supported bythe R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely usedamong statisticians and data miners fordeveloping statistical software and data analysis.应用领域：数据处理\n\nObjective-C\nObjective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming languagethat adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.It was the main programming language used by Apple for the OS Xand iOS operating systems, and their respectiveapplication programming interfaces (APIs) Cocoa and Cocoa Touchprior to the introduction of Swift.应用领域：苹果周边\n\nPerl\nPerl can be used and was utilized for a variety of uses.Bio-Informatics, Databases, E-mail Handling with Perl, Games and Multimedia,GUI (Graphical User Interface) Development, Multi-tasking and Networking,Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing, andTelnet/SSH (Remote login and command execution)应用领域：\n\n\n                ", "mainLikeNum": ["0 "], "mainBookmarkNum": "0"}
