Most of my work was done in Visual Basic because it's what I was most comfortable with, plus a smattering of other languages (R, C, JavaScript, etc... Pascal, Applescript, Hypertext and BASIC, which I learned in 1979, if you go far back enough). A couple of years ago, I decided to use Python exclusively so that I could improve my coding. I ended up re-inventing many wheels -- which I didn't mind too much, because I enjoy solving puzzles. But sometimes it's good to have a more efficient, Pythonesque approach, and time after time I found myself having \"aha!\" moments, realizing I'd been doing things the hard, excessively verbose way for no reason. Here is a list of ten Python idioms that would have made my life much easier if I'd thought to search for them early on.\n\nMissing from this list are some idioms such as list comprehensions and lambda functions, which are very Pythonesque and very efficient and very cool, but also very difficult to miss because they're mentioned on StackOverflow every other answer! Also ternary x if y else z constructions, decorators and generators, because I don't use them very often.\n\nThere's also anIPython notebook nbviewer version of this document if you prefer.\n\n1. Python 3-style printing in Python 2\n\nOne of the things that kept me from concentrating on Python was this whole version 2 - version 3 debacle. Finally I went with Python 2 because all the libraries I wanted were not 3-compatible, and I figured if I needed to, I would laboriously adjust my code later.\n\nBut really, the biggest differences in everyday programming are printing and division, and now I just import from future. Now that almost all the libraries I use heavily are v3-compliant, I'll make the switch soon.\n\nmynumber = 5\n\nprint \"Python 2:\"\nprint \"The number is %d\" % (mynumber)\nprint mynumber / 2,\nprint mynumber // 2\n\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom __future__ import division\n\nprint('\\nPython 3:')\nprint(\"The number is {}\".format(mynumber))\nprint(mynumber / 2, end=' ')\nprint(mynumber // 2)\n\n\nPython 2:\nThe number is 5\n2 2\n\nPython 3:\nThe number is 5\n2.5 2\n\n\nOh, and here's an easter egg for C programmers:\n\nfrom __future__ import braces\n  File \"<ipython-input-3-2aebb3fc8ecf>\", line 1\n    from __future__ import braces\nSyntaxError: not a chance\n\n\n2. enumerate(list)\n\nIt might seem obvious that you should be able to iterate over a list and its index at the same time, but I used counter variables or slices for an embarrassingly long time.\n\nmylist = [\"It's\", 'only', 'a', 'model']\n\nfor index, item in enumerate(mylist):\n    print(index, item)\n\n\n0 It's\n1 only\n2 a\n3 model\n\n\n3. Chained comparison operators\n\nBecause I was so used to statically typed languages (where this idiom would be ambiguous), it never occurred to me to put two operators in the same expression. In many languages, 4 > 3 > 2 would return as False, because (4 > 3) would be evaluated as a boolean, and then True > 2 would be evaluated as False.\n\nmynumber = 3\n\nif 4 > mynumber > 2:\n    print(\"Chained comparison operators work! \\n\" * 3)\n\n\nChained comparison operators work! \nChained comparison operators work! \nChained comparison operators work! \n\n\n4. collections.Counter\n\nThe collections library is, like, the best thing ever. Stackoverflow turned me on to ordered dicts early on, but I kept using a snippet to create dicts to count occurrences of results in my code. One of these days, I'll figure out a use for collections.deque.\n\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom random import randrange\nimport pprint\nmycounter = Counter()\nfor i in range(100):\n    random_number = randrange(10)\n    mycounter[random_number] += 1\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i, mycounter[i])\n\n\n0 10\n1 10\n2 13\n3 6\n4 6\n5 11\n6 10\n7 14\n8 12\n9 8\n\n\n5. Dict comprehensions\n\nA rite of passage for a Python programmer is understanding list comprehensions, but eventually I realized dict comprehensions are just as useful -- especially for reversing dicts.\n\nmy_phrase = [\"No\", \"one\", \"expects\", \"the\", \"Spanish\", \"Inquisition\"]\nmy_dict = {key: value for value, key in enumerate(my_phrase)}\nprint(my_dict)\nreversed_dict = {value: key for key, value in my_dict.items()}\nprint(reversed_dict)\n\n\n{'Inquisition': 5, 'No': 0, 'expects': 2, 'one': 1, 'Spanish': 4, 'the': 3}\n{0: 'No', 1: 'one', 2: 'expects', 3: 'the', 4: 'Spanish', 5: 'Inquisition'}\n\n\n6. Executing shell commands with subprocess\n\nI used to use the os library exclusively to manipulate files; now I can even programmatically call complex command-line tools like ffmpeg for video editing\n\n(And yes, I use Windows, so do all of my clients. But I have the good grace to be embarrassed about it!)\n\nNote that the particular subprocess I picked would be much better done with the os library; I just wanted a command everyone would be familiar with. And in general, shell=True is a VERY bad idea, I put it here so that the command output would appear in the IPython notebook cell. Don't try this at home, kids!\n\nimport subprocess\noutput = subprocess.check_output('dir', shell=True)\nprint(output)\n Volume in drive C is OS\n Volume Serial Number is [REDACTED]\n Directory of C:\\Users\\David\\Documents\\[REDACTED]\n\n\n2014-11-26  06:04 AM    <DIR>          .\n2014-11-26  06:04 AM    <DIR>          ..\n2014-11-23  11:47 AM    <DIR>          .git\n2014-11-26  06:06 AM    <DIR>          .ipynb_checkpoints\n2014-11-23  08:59 AM    <DIR>          CCCma\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM            19,450 colorbrewdict.py\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM            92,175 imagecompare.ipynb\n2014-11-23  08:41 AM    <DIR>          Japan_Earthquakes\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM             1,100 LICENSE\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM             5,263 monty_monte.ipynb\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM            31,082 pocket_tumblr_reddit_api.ipynb\n2014-11-26  06:04 AM             3,211 README.md\n2014-11-26  06:14 AM            19,898 top_10_python_idioms.ipynb\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM             5,813 tree_convert_mega_to_gexf.ipynb\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM             5,453 tree_convert_mega_to_json.ipynb\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM             1,211 tree_convert_newick_to_json.py\n2014-09-03  06:58 AM            55,970 weather_ML.ipynb\n              11 File(s)        240,626 bytes\n               6 Dir(s)  180,880,490,496 bytes free\n\n\n7. dict .get() and .iteritems() methods\n\nHaving a default value when a key does not exist has all kinds of uses, and just like enumerate() for lists, you can iterate over key, value tuples in dicts\n\nmy_dict = {'name': 'Lancelot', 'quest': 'Holy Grail', 'favourite_color': 'blue'}\n\nprint(my_dict.get('airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow', 'African or European?\\n'))\n\nfor key, value in my_dict.iteritems():\n    print(key, value, sep=\": \")\n\n\nAfrican or European?\n\nquest: Holy Grail\nname: Lancelot\nfavourite_color: blue\n\n\n8.

Introspection tools\n\nI was aware of dir(), but I had assumed help() would do the same thing as IPython's ? magic command. It does way more.

PEP-8 compliant string chaining\n\nPEP8\nis the style guide for Python code. Among other things, it directs that lines not be over 80 characters long and that indenting by consistent over line breaks.\n\nThis can be accomplished with a combination of backslashes \\; parentheses () with commas , ; and addition operators +; but every one of these solutions is awkward for multiline strings. There is a multiline string signifier, the triple quote, but it does not allow consistent indenting over line breaks.\n\nThere is a solution: parentheses without commas. I don't know why this works, but I'm glad it does.\n\nmy_long_text = (\"We are no longer the knights who say Ni! \"\n                \"We are now the knights who say ekki-ekki-\"\n                \"ekki-p'tang-zoom-boing-z'nourrwringmm!\")\nprint(my_long_text)\n\n\nWe are no longer the knights who say Ni!
