But first of all, we should figure out why we need iterator and why it is important for us.\nFirst, just think about a simple for loop in C++:\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\n        cout << i << \" \";\n    cout << endl;\n\n    system(\"pause\");\n    return 0;\n}\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    int a[] = { 1, 2, 3 };\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\n        cout << a[i] << \" \";\n    cout << endl;\n\n    system(\"pause\");\n    return 0;\n}\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    int a[] = { 1, 2, 3 };\n    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\n        cout << *(a+i) << \" \";\n    cout << endl;\n\n    system(\"pause\");\n    return 0;\n}\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    vector<int> a;\n    a.push_back(1);\n    a.push_back(2);\n    a.push_back(3);\n\n    for (vector<int>::iterator i = a.begin(); \n                               i != a.end();\n                               i++)\n        cout << *i << \" \";\n    cout << endl;\n\n    system(\"pause\");\n    return 0;\n}\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main()\n{\n    vector<int> a;\n    a.push_back(1);\n    a.push_back(2);\n    a.push_back(3);\n\n    for (auto i : a)\n        cout << i << \" \";\n    cout << endl;\n\n    system(\"pause\");\n    return 0;\n}\nIn C++, if we implement a container of our own, and we want to use for loop or while loop to traverse it like basic data type, we can use iterator by implement\nSo first let's analysis this example in\nC++ version\nPython version\nC# version\n\n                ", "mainLikeNum": ["0 "], "mainBookmarkNum": "0"}
