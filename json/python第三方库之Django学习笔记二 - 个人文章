You’ll use it shortly.\ndjango.contrib.auth – An authentication system.\ndjango.contrib.contenttypes – A framework for content types.\ndjango.contrib.sessions – A session framework.\ndjango.contrib.messages – A messaging framework.\ndjango.contrib.staticfiles – A framework for managing static files.\n\nThese applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.\nSome of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:manage.py migrate # 创建表结构\n2、创建模型\n\n3、激活模型That small bit of model code gives Django a lot of information. With it, Django is able to:\nCreate a database schema (CREATE TABLE statements) for this app.Create a Python database-access API for accessing Question and Choice objects.But first we need to tell our project that the polls app is installed.\n\n执行命令：manage.py makemigrations polls   # By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a migration.\n\n执行成功后目录结构如下图：\n\n\nNow, run migrate again to create those model tables in your database:\n\nremember the three-step guide to making model changes:\nChange your models (in models.py).Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changesRun python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.\n\n                ", "mainLikeNum": ["0 "], "mainBookmarkNum": "1"}
